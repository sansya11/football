# Football Player Re-Identification System - Technical Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive football player re-identification system that leverages YOLOv11 for object detection and Deep SORT for tracking and re-identification. The system processes a 15-second video clip to maintain consistent player IDs even when players temporarily leave the frame and reappear, achieving robust performance through advanced computer vision techniques.

## 2. Approach Summary

### 2.1 System Architecture

The system employs a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Object Detection**: YOLOv11 model detects players and ball in each frame
2. **Tracking**: Deep SORT algorithm associates detections across frames
3. **Re-Identification**: Appearance-based features enable ID persistence
4. **Visualization**: Annotated video output with player IDs and statistics

### 2.2 Technical Stack

- **Detection Framework**: YOLOv11 (Ultralytics)
- **Tracking Algorithm**: Deep SORT with MobileNet embeddings
- **Video Processing**: OpenCV
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch
- **Development Language**: Python 3.8+

## 3. Detection Method

### 3.1 YOLOv11 Implementation

The system uses a pre-trained YOLOv11 model fine-tuned for football player detection:

```python
class PlayerDetector:
    def __init__(self, model_path: str, confidence_threshold: float = 0.5):
        self.model = YOLO(model_path)
        self.confidence_threshold = confidence_threshold
        self.class_names = {0: "player", 1: "ball"}
```

**Key Features:**
- Single-shot detection with bounding box regression
- Confidence-based filtering (threshold: 0.5)
- Class-specific detection (player: 0, ball: 1)
- GPU acceleration support

### 3.2 Detection Optimization

**Filtering Strategies:**
- **Confidence Threshold**: Removes low-confidence detections
- **Area Filtering**: Eliminates noise based on bounding box area
- **Boundary Clipping**: Ensures detections stay within frame bounds

```python
def filter_detections_by_area(detections, min_area=500.0, max_area=50000.0):
    # Filter detections by bounding box area
    return [det for det in detections if min_area <= calculate_area(det['bbox']) <= max_area]
```

## 4. Tracking + Re-Identification Method

### 4.1 Deep SORT Algorithm

Deep SORT combines:
- **Kalman Filter**: Motion prediction and state estimation
- **Appearance Descriptor**: Deep learning features for re-identification
- **Hungarian Algorithm**: Optimal assignment of detections to tracks

### 4.2 Configuration Parameters

```python
PlayerTracker(
    max_age=30,              # Frames to keep track without detection
    n_init=3,                # Frames needed to confirm track
    max_cosine_distance=0.4, # Maximum cosine distance for matching
    nn_budget=100,           # Maximum features per identity
    embedder="mobilenet"     # Feature extraction model
)
```

### 4.3 Re-Identification Process

1. **Feature Extraction**: MobileNet extracts appearance features
2. **Cosine Distance**: Measures similarity between feature vectors
3. **Assignment**: Hungarian algorithm matches detections to tracks
4. **Track Management**: Maintains tracks through occlusion and absence

### 4.4 Track States

- **Tentative**: New track requiring confirmation
- **Confirmed**: Established track with consistent detections
- **Deleted**: Track removed after prolonged absence

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Frame Processing Pipeline

```python
def _process_frame(self, frame, frame_number):
    # 1. Detect players
    detections = self.detector.detect_players_only(frame)
    
    # 2. Filter detections
    filtered_detections = filter_detections_by_area(detections)
    
    # 3. Update tracker
    tracked_objects = self.tracker.update(filtered_detections, frame)
    
    # 4. Annotate frame
    annotated_frame = draw_tracked_objects(frame, tracked_objects)
    
    return annotated_frame
```

### 5.2 Real-Time Processing Simulation

The system processes frames sequentially to simulate real-time conditions:
- No future frame information used
- Frame-by-frame processing maintains temporal consistency
- Processing statistics logged for performance monitoring

### 5.3 Visualization System
